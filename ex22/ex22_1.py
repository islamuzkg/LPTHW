# The use of \ character encodes difficult to type charaters into a string.
print ' I am 6\'2" tall' # escape single-quote inside string, we could do the same for double-quotes.

# \n is used tof new line and \t is for tab character
print "\t This is cat food"

# This is little advanced, but we can try x = int(raw_input()) which gets the number as string from raw_input() then converts it to an integer using int().
